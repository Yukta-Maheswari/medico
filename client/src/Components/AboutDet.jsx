      <p>This website was created as a project with a purpose to create a platform where citizens would be able to upload the medicine's name they don't need anymore and then those medicines would be collected and re-distributed among needy people. Our application aims to reduce the medical wastage happening all over India by creating a simpler andeasier way of communication between the citizens and the NGO's. This will also cut-off the demands of medicines and hence the cost.
